_first verse_
Did you ever thought that she was quite fierce
When you saw her face
And then thought you were dead?

Did you ever feel her standards were high
Looking at your results
And hearing her expectations
Of the marks she minimally expected.

But she can be quite funny,
especially when she is teaching
